# RC-Car-Controlled-via-Bluetooth
This project demonstrates the design and development of a Bluetooth controlled RC car using Arduino UNO. The car is controlled wirelessly using a smartphone through a Bluetooth connection. Directional commands such as forward, backward, left, and right are sent from a mobile application to the Bluetooth module, which communicates with the Arduino.
